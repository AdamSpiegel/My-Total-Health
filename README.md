## <a name="considerations"></a>Considerations :thinking::wrench:		
<!-- things we learned, things that went wrong -->
Git offered some challenges. Working together on merging code from collaborators has been an engaging experience. Heroku produced some issues, namely capitalization errors and deployment problems.  Our handlebars files in particular need to be structured so the route properly gives the user the ability to submit data. We worked together to resolve issues by bouncing ideas off one another and learning together as a collaborative team!  Great team project experience! 


## <a name="license-info"></a>License Info :ticket:	
The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1980s. As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.
